# Mastering CSS Grid and Flexbox

Creating modern, responsive layouts is essential for today's web applications. CSS Grid and Flexbox are two powerful tools that can help you achieve stunning designs with less code and more flexibility.

## CSS Grid: The Two-Dimensional Layout System

CSS Grid excels at creating complex, two-dimensional layouts:

### Basic Grid Setup

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 20px;
}
```

### Advanced Grid Features

- **Grid areas** for semantic layout definitions
- **Auto-placement** for dynamic content
- **Responsive grids** with minmax() and auto-fit

## Flexbox: The One-Dimensional Layout Tool

Flexbox is perfect for arranging items in a single direction:

### Flex Container Properties

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

### Flex Item Properties

- **flex-grow** for proportional sizing
- **flex-shrink** for responsive behavior
- **align-self** for individual item alignment

## When to Use Which?

- **Use Grid** for two-dimensional layouts (rows AND columns)
- **Use Flexbox** for one-dimensional layouts (either rows OR columns)
- **Combine both** for complex, nested layouts

## Best Practices

1. Start with mobile-first design
2. Use semantic HTML structure
3. Test across different screen sizes
4. Consider accessibility in your layouts

## Conclusion

Mastering CSS Grid and Flexbox opens up endless possibilities for creating beautiful, responsive web layouts. Practice with different combinations to find what works best for your projects.
